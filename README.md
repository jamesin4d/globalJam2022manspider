an unfinished game jam project for posterity.
man spider was intended to be a 3D, first person game where you play a desert spider who has been licked by a radioactive hippie in search of new psychedelic substances to try. I made art, music, code, everything in here is what i was able to accomplish alone over the course of roughly 72 hours.

I enjoy the idea quite a bit and learned things as well, so that while this repo will never change, and always remain a broken mess of a non-game, as a self taught programmer/artist/musician/human being, i'm proud that i'm to a point where in 72 hours creative artistry of all types can pour out of my brain into reality in ways such as manspider.
