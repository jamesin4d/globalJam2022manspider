# globalJam2022manspider
an unfinished game jam project for posterity.
man spider was intended to be a 3d first person game where you play a desert spider who has been licked by a radioactive hippie in search of new psychedelic substances to try. I made art, music, code, everything in here is what i was able to accomplish alone over the course of roughly 72 hours.
